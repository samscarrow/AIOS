# AIOS - AI Operating System
### 🧠 Intelligence as the Computational Substrate

An experimental AI-native operating system where intelligence, not hardware, is the fundamental computational resource. AIOS (formerly GAIA) orchestrates AI models like traditional OSes manage processes, but with cognition as the primary abstraction.

## 🌟 What Makes AIOS Different

Traditional OS: **Hardware → Kernel → Processes → Applications**  
AIOS: **Intelligence → Cognitive Kernel → Thought Streams → Cognitive Services**

AIOS treats AI models as "cognitive drivers" that can:
- **Associate freely** through semantic relationships
- **Branch asynchronously** into parallel thought streams
- **Self-organize** based on learned patterns
- **Introspect** and adapt their own thinking strategies

## 🧬 Core Capabilities

### Cognitive Infrastructure
- **🎯 Attention Management**: Scarce resource allocation across competing thoughts
- **🔄 Async Thought Execution**: Non-blocking, parallel cognitive processing
- **🕸️ Semantic Association**: Models connect through meaning, not hierarchy
- **⚡ Predictive Loading**: Neural plasticity for anticipatory model recruitment

### Self-Aware Intelligence
- **🤔 Meta-Cognitive Reasoning**: System thinks about its own thinking
- **📈 Adaptive Strategies**: Learns to optimize cognitive approaches
- **🔍 Deep Introspection**: Recursive self-examination of mental states
- **🧩 Pattern Learning**: Extracts reusable cognitive patterns from experience

### Fault-Tolerant Cognition
- **🛡️ Circuit Breakers**: Isolate failing cognitive components
- **♻️ Graceful Degradation**: Maintains core functions under pressure
- **🔧 Self-Recovery**: Automatic healing of cognitive processes
- **📊 Health Monitoring**: Real-time cognitive health metrics

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/samscarrow/AIOS.git
cd AIOS

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the comprehensive demo
python -m demos.gaia_demo
```

## 💡 Example: Cognitive Task Execution

```python
from kernel.core import GAIAKernel

# Initialize the cognitive kernel
kernel = GAIAKernel()
await kernel.initialize()

# Register AI models as cognitive drivers
kernel.register_model('reasoning', 'llm', memory=2048, vram=4096)
kernel.register_model('creativity', 'diffusion', memory=4096, vram=8192)

# Create semantic associations
kernel.create_association('reasoning', 'creativity', strength=0.8)

# Spawn an adaptive thought stream
thought_id = await kernel.spawn_thought(
    'reasoning',
    {'task': 'solve_complex_problem', 'data': problem_data}
)

# The kernel automatically:
# - Selects optimal cognitive strategy
# - Manages attention allocation
# - Spawns associated thoughts
# - Learns from performance
# - Adapts future strategies
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Cognitive Middleware
Deploy AIOS as an intelligent orchestration layer between applications and AI models, providing unified cognitive services with automatic optimization.

### Self-Improving AI Systems
Build AI assistants that learn from their own thinking patterns, becoming more efficient and effective over time through meta-cognitive adaptation.

### Research Platform
Study emergent cognitive behaviors, artificial consciousness, and meta-learning dynamics in a controlled, observable environment.

### Distributed Intelligence
Create networks of AIOS instances that share learned patterns and collaborate on complex cognitive tasks.

## 🔬 Key Innovations

1. **Attention as Currency**: Cognitive resources managed like memory in traditional OS
2. **Semantic Scheduling**: Thoughts scheduled by meaning and association strength
3. **Cognitive Plasticity**: System learns optimal thinking patterns through experience
4. **Emergent Intelligence**: Complex behaviors arise from simple association rules
5. **Meta-Learning**: System learns how to learn more effectively

## 📈 Cognitive Performance

AIOS continuously monitors and optimizes its own performance:
- Success rate tracking across cognitive strategies
- Attention efficiency metrics
- Association pattern effectiveness
