# GAIA - General AI Architecture

An experimental AI-native operating system that treats intelligence as the fundamental computational substrate.

## Core Concepts

- **Associative Memory Architecture**: Models relate through semantic meaning, not hierarchies
- **Predictive Model Loading**: Neural recruitment patterns for anticipatory resource allocation  
- **Interruptible Associations**: Thought streams that yield mid-execution for better associations
- **Async Parallel Branching**: Multiple trains of thought running simultaneously

## Architecture Components

- `/kernel` - Core AI kernel with attention management and resource orchestration
- `/memory` - Associative memory systems and semantic graphs
- `/models` - Model executors and association engines
- `/orchestrator` - Async thought orchestration and stream processing
- `/demos` - Example implementations and demonstrations
- `/tests` - Test suites for all components
- `/docs` - Documentation and design specifications

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m gaia.kernel.main
```

## Vision

GAIA reimagines computing where:
- Intelligence is the primary resource, not CPU/memory
- Models associate freely like human thoughts
- The kernel learns and adapts over time
- Cognitive plasticity emerges from the architecture
