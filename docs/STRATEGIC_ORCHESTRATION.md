# Strategic Orchestration in AIOS

## ðŸ§  Cognitive-Aware Strategic Orchestration

The AIOS Strategic Orchestrator provides **collaborative reasoning** and **attention-aware orchestration** for AIOS agents, integrating seamlessly with the cognitive kernel's attention management and thought stream processing.

## ðŸŽ¯ AIOS Integration

### Cognitive Architecture
- **Thought Streams**: AIOS-native collaborative reasoning sessions
- **Attention Management**: Dynamic allocation based on task complexity
- **Semantic Context**: Deep integration with AIOS semantic processing
- **Cognitive States**: thinking â†’ synthesizing â†’ concluded workflow

### AIOS-Aware Tools

#### `initiate_thought_stream`
Start cognitive processing with AIOS attention allocation:
```json
{
  "task_description": "Optimize AIOS memory management",
  "agent_name": "Agent-Alpha",
  "cognitive_type": "reasoning",
  "complexity": "complex",
  "semantic_tags": ["aios", "memory", "optimization"]
}
```

**AIOS Features:**
- Automatic attention weight calculation
- Registration with cognitive kernel
- Semantic context preservation

#### `contribute_thought`
Add cognitive processing with attention requests:
```json
{
  "stream_id": "ts_abc123",
  "agent_name": "Agent-Beta",
  "thought_content": "Memory optimization requires balancing model loading...",
  "cognitive_action": "analysis", 
  "attention_request": 0.6
}
```

**AIOS Features:**
- Attention availability checking
- Cognitive action classification
- Resource consumption tracking

#### `execute_strategic_orchestration`
Execute with AIOS model memory management:
```json
{
  "stream_id": "ts_abc123",
  "agent_name": "Agent-Alpha",
  "execution_prompt": "Design AIOS memory optimization algorithm",
  "task_type": "reasoning"
}
```

**AIOS Features:**
- Integration with ModelMemoryManager
- Cognitive efficiency scoring
- Strategic decision persistence

#### `search_thought_streams`
Semantic search with cognitive awareness:
```json
{
  "agent_name": "Agent-Delta",
  "semantic_query": "memory optimization",
  "cognitive_type": "reasoning",
  "attention_threshold": 0.5
}
```

**AIOS Features:**
- Semantic tag filtering
- Attention level prioritization
- Cognitive state awareness

## ðŸ”„ AIOS Cognitive Workflow

### Multi-Agent Thought Streams
1. **Agent Alpha** initiates thought stream with cognitive task classification
2. **AIOS Kernel** allocates attention based on complexity and current load
3. **Agent Beta** contributes analysis, requesting additional attention
4. **Agent Gamma** synthesizes perspectives, building semantic context
5. **Agent Alpha** executes strategic orchestration with AIOS model management
6. **Any Agent** can search and build on the cognitive artifacts

### Example AIOS Session
```
Thought Stream: "AIOS Cognitive Resource Optimization"
â”œâ”€ Attention Allocated: 0.8 (complex reasoning task)
â”œâ”€ Agent Alpha (analysis): "Current bottlenecks in attention allocation..."
â”œâ”€ Agent Beta (critique): "Need to consider semantic coherence..." 
â”œâ”€ Agent Gamma (synthesis): "Combining attention + semantics..."
â””â”€ Strategic Execution: AIOS cognitive orchestration â†’ optimized solution
```

## ðŸ§¬ Deep AIOS Integration

### Cognitive Kernel Integration
- **Attention Allocation**: Requests cognitive resources from AIOS kernel
- **Thought Stream Registry**: Registers collaborative sessions with kernel
- **Semantic Processing**: Leverages AIOS semantic association capabilities
- **Model Memory Management**: Integrates with existing ModelMemoryManager

### Database Schema (AIOS-Aware)
- **thought_streams**: Cognitive tasks with attention levels and semantic context
- **cognitive_interactions**: Agent contributions with attention consumption
- **strategic_decisions**: Orchestration outcomes with cognitive efficiency metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **Cognitive Efficiency**: Ratio of output quality to attention consumed
- **Attention Utilization**: How well allocated attention was used
- **Semantic Coherence**: Consistency of thought stream context
- **Collaborative Depth**: Number of agents and cognitive actions

## ðŸš€ Getting Started with AIOS

### For AIOS Agents
```python
# Initialize with AIOS kernel awareness
orchestrator = AIOSStrategicOrchestrator(aios_kernel=kernel)

# Initiate cognitive processing
stream = await orchestrator.initiate_thought_stream(
    "Complex AIOS reasoning task",
    "MyAgent",
    cognitive_type="reasoning",
    complexity="complex"
)

# Contribute with attention awareness
await orchestrator.contribute_thought(
    stream["stream_id"], 
    "MyAgent",
    "My cognitive contribution...",
    attention_request=0.7  # Request 70% attention
)
```

### For AIOS Integration
```python
# Register with existing AIOS infrastructure
from aios.core.cognitive_kernel import CognitiveKernel
from aios.orchestrator.aios_strategic_orchestrator import AIOSStrategicOrchestrator

kernel = CognitiveKernel()
orchestrator = AIOSStrategicOrchestrator(aios_kernel=kernel)

# Orchestrator automatically:
# - Requests attention allocation
# - Registers thought streams with kernel
# - Integrates with ModelMemoryManager
# - Reports cognitive efficiency metrics
```

## ðŸ“Š AIOS-Specific Benefits

### Cognitive Resource Management
- **Smart Attention Allocation**: Dynamic based on task complexity
- **Resource Contention Handling**: Graceful degradation when attention scarce
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Learn optimal attention patterns over time

### Semantic Intelligence
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain semantic coherence across agents
- **Association Networks**: Connect related thought streams semantically
- **Knowledge Building**: Accumulate cognitive artifacts for future use

### Self-Aware Orchestration
- **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**: System reasons about its own reasoning
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Learn from cognitive efficiency patterns
- **Recursive Improvement**: Orchestration improves its own orchestration
